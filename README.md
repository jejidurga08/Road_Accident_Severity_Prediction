# Road_Accident_Severity_Prediction
This repository contains a Deep Learning-based Road Accident Severity Prediction System using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models. The project leverages PyTorch Geometric to model accident data as a graph, capturing spatial and contextual relationships between accident locations.
